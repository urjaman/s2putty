        The s2font file format
        ----------------------

The s2font file format is a simple file format for bitmapped
monospaced fonts, mainly designed for Nethack and PuTTY for Symbian
OS.

All data is in network byte order, i.e. most significant byte
first. Bitmap data is laid out most significant bit on the
left. Bitmap data uses an integer number of bytes per row, i.e. the
width in bytes of a row is
        byteWidth = (charWidth+7)/8


The file starts with a header as follows:

Offset  Length  Data
--------------------
0       4       Magic identifier: 0x53324f4e, "S2FN"
4       4       File format version. This document specifies format version
                0x00010000.
8       4       Number of characters
12      4       Character width in pixels
16      4       Character height in pixels
24      var.    Characted encoding, as a null-terminated ASCII string.
                Typical values are "CP437" for DOS fonts and "UCS-2" for 
                Unicode fonts


After the header follow n characters:

Offset  Length                  Data
------------------------------------
0       2                       Character code. The interpretation of 
                                this value depends on the encoding in use
2       charHeight*byteWidth    Character bitmap data
