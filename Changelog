Disabled T9 and text case from S60 terminal text input. It seems next
to impossible to get useful T9 FEP behavior with a control that is
fundamentally not an editor, so this ensures that at least multitap
input works. T9 can still be used by selecting "Send text" from the
menu.

Made the common terminal control base class FEP-aware. There are still
some bugs left: On S60 v1 the case is wrong (text case is enabled by
force and works incorrectly), and on S60 S60 v2.0 text case doesn't
work right. Also on S60 v2.0 it isn't possible to send Enter by
pressing '0' three times. On S60 v2.6 everything works perfectly
however.
Note that there is also some debug logging code left that should be
removed later. It is compiled out by default though.

Implemented a new terminal control class using S2Font bitmap fonts,
and preliminarily changed the S60 version to use it. Much font-related
functionality is still missing in the S60 UI, and the font file in use
is hardcoded, but basic functionality seems OK.

Moved most text color logic to the terminal control base class. This
simplifies concrete terminal control implementations and reduces code
size, but has a small performance cost.

in the whitespace optimization logic in the terminal control that
occasionally corrupts parts of the display.

Rewrote cursor handling and terminal control. The terminal control is
now responsible for drawing the cursor, and maintains a copy of the
terminal contents. This enables display refreshes without calls to the
engine and acts as a basis for copy/paste support.
This change breaks S60 and S90 until they are updated.

Changed to use an X11 Unicode font with custom bitmap rendering
routines instead of system fonts.  The 7710 only has a single
monospaced font, NewCourier, which doesn't behave too well. The fonts
are X11 fixed fonts by by Markus Kuhn and others. See
http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs-fonts.html. Text rendering routines
were originally written for Nethack for Symbian OS, but the license
was intentionally the same as PuTTY uses so the code can be copied
directly.

Incorporated Series 80 2.0 (Nokia 9500 Communicator) support to the
main source tree. The S80 2.0 version is still very basic, and is
missing network connection establishment code and narrow indicator
support. This update also breaks 9200 support.
