	[2507873daa7f]

	* ui/s60/sendgrid.cpp:

	phones where the asterisk key doesn't produce the expected keycodes.
	[fda6975cdb2f]

	* engine/puttysymbian/epocnet.cpp:
	Don't bind the socket before connecting. This seems to fix at least

	* engine/putty/ssh.c, engine/puttyengineimp.cpp,

	snapshots.
	[2b0016b05ce0]

	* ui/s60/terminalview.cpp:
	Implemented very rudimentary support for the LockSize setting. The
	current implementation simply ignores all resize events, which makes
	the UI look corrupted, and therefore it is not accessible through
	the settings UI.
	[f6fc377a8878]

	* ui/s60/terminalcontainer.cpp:
	Integrated another patch from Damion Yates to force a 80x24 terminal
